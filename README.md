# Project: Private Events 

A project built for [The Odin Project Ruby on Rails Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/associations) to implement learnings about Active Record Associations. The goal is to create an event manager site, which allows users to create events and invite other users.

## Features 
---
Users can create and manage events, as well as see events they are attending or have created. Events are sorted into two categories, upcoming and past. Invites can be sent for upcoming events, but not past events. However, since this is a learning activity, delete and edit features have not been implemented. 

Authentication is rudimentary. Users are able to create accounts with just an username, and do not need to provide a password. 

Although design was not a requirement, basic styling was added using the [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) gem, which is a modern CSS framework based on Flexbox, built for Rails.
